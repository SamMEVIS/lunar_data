1. Lunar_bridge 
1.1 What is Lunar Bridge? 
Lunar Bridge is a script that manages shared configurations for all paid Lunar Scripts 
products. It allows administrators to configure settings such as framework integration, 
notifications, text UI, and dispatch once, and these settings are automatically applied 
across all Lunar Scripts products. This ensures consistent and efficient configuration 
across all scripts. 
1.2 Lunar Bridge - FAQ 
1.2.1 Can I integrate my own dispatch system, and if so, where? 
Yes, you can integrate a new dispatch script in 
lunar_bridge\dispatch\server.lua. Don't forget to select the correct dispatch 
system in config\config.lua. 
1.2.2 Where can I find the framework folders? 
All framework-related resources within Lunar Scripts can be found in 
lunar_bridge\framework\. You can choose between qb or esx. 
1.2.3 How can I add more jobs that receive dispatch notifications? 
Navigate to lunar_bridge\config\config.lua and locate the Config.Dispatch 
function. Here, you can configure the jobs that should receive dispatch notifications. 
1.2.4 How can I make changes to the Lunar 3D prompt? 
Go to lunar_bridge\config\config.lua and look for Config.Prompts. You can 
modify the prompt configuration here. 
1.2.5 I want to use a target resource instead of the Lunar 3D prompt. How can I do 
this? 
In lunar_bridge\config\config.lua, find Config.Target. By default, this is set to 
false. Change it to true to enable the use of a target resource. 
11 
1.2.6 How can I use black money as a reward in the Heist contracts script? 
First, navigate to lunar_bridge\config\config.lua and find Config.BlackMoney. 
Configure your black money item and choose whether it uses metadata. 
Next, you need to modify the account type for each contract. Locate the respective 
contract file in lunar_heistcontracts\contracts\ and change account = money 
to the black money item you configured earlier. Below are specific lines to edit for each 
heist: 
• Art Asylum: Line 367 and 597 - Change money to black_money 
• Bobcat: Line 102 - Change money to black_money 
• Cash Exchange: Line 85 and 136 - Change money to black_money 
• Fleeca: Line 62 and 98 - Change money to black_money 
• Laundromat: Line 94 - Change money to black_money 
• Maze Bank: Line 43 and 381 - Change money to black_money 
• Pacific: Line 177 and 284 - Change money to black_money 
• Paleto: Line 173, 196, and 240 - Change money to black_money 
By following these steps, you can successfully configure black money rewards in 
heists.

The Heist Contracts script is highly detailed, so I’ve broken the FAQ into multiple 
sections to make it easier to understand. The structure is as follows: 
• First, we’ll cover the config.lua. 
• Then, the client-side (cl_edit) and server-side (sv_edit) configurations. 
• Lastly, we’ll look at general contract settings and common questions. This 
section does not go into specifics about individual contracts but instead covers 
the general settings and frequently asked questions. 
2.1 Lunar Heist Contracts Config.lua - FAQ 
2.1.1 How often are new heist contracts generated?
New heist contracts are generated every Config.generator.minutesBetweenGeneration minutes. By default, this is set to 2 minutes (it is recommended not to change this for performance reasons).

2.1.2 What is the maximum number of heist contracts that can be generated?
The system stops generating new heist contracts once it reaches Config.generator.max. The default maximum is 16 (it is advised not to set this higher than 32).

A player can hold up to Config.generator.playerLimit heist contracts. The default limit is 2.

2.1.4 How frequently are expired heist contracts removed?
Expired heist contracts are automatically cleared every 10 minutes, based on Config.generator.clearCron.

2.1.5 Can multiple heists run at the same time?
Certain heists cannot be started simultaneously. These can be defined in Config.limitedHeists.

2.1.6 Can I override how cryptocurrency or experience is calculated in heist contracts?
Yes, you can override these settings by setting Config.overrideCrypto or Config.overrideExperience to true and implementing custom logic in sv_edit.lua.

2.1.7 How can I give admin access to the heist contract system?
For ESX, assign admin groups in Config.adminGroups. For QBCore, add the following line to your server.cfg: add_ace group.admin contracts_admin allow.

2.1.8 Where can players buy heist-related items?
Players can purchase heist-related items from an NPC defined in Config.ped. Items include hacking tools, explosives, and drills.

2.1.9 What currency is used to buy heist-related items?
The Config.ped.buyAccount setting determines the currency, which defaults to in-game money.

2.1.10 Can players sell heist-related items for money or cryptocurrency?
Yes, players can sell heist-related items for cash or cryptocurrency, as specified in Config.ped.sellItems.

2.1.11 How many players are displayed on the heist leaderboard?
The leaderboard displays the top Config.leaderboard.limit players. The default setting is 10.

2.1.12 How can I translate the heist contract script?
To translate the heist contract script, create a new JSON file in the lunar_heistcontracts\locales\ directory. Use the language abbreviation as the filename (e.g., en.json for English). Then, add your translations within that file.

2.1.13 I didn’t receive any SQL files. What should I do?
This is normal. The SQL files are automatically created and set up when you start the heist contract script for the first time.
15 
2.2 Lunar Heist Contracts CL_EDIT  – FAQ 
2.2.1 How can I adjust the minigames in heist contracts, such as time and quantity?
You can modify the minigames used in heist contracts by editing the lunar_heistcontracts\config\cl_edit file. Look for Editable.minigames, where you can adjust settings like time and quantity for each heist contract and its associated minigame.

2.2.2 Can I use other minigames in heist contracts?
Yes, you can. In the Editable.minigames section, you can modify the export and associated code to use a different minigame of your choice for heist contracts.

2.2.3 Can I use minigames from lunar_minigames in other heist contract scripts?
Yes, it is possible. You can use the exports from cl_edit Editable.minigames and apply them in other scripts.

2.2.4 I’m not getting vehicle keys during a heist contract mission.
Ensure that your vehicle key script is integrated into the cl_edit functions Editable.addKeys and Editable.removeKeys for heist contracts.

2.2.5 My item icons are not loading in heist contracts.
Check the cl_edit function Editable.setInventoryBusy and make sure the path to the images is correct. This issue typically occurs with unsupported inventories for heist contracts; if that’s the case, it would have been mentioned.
2.3 Lunar Heist Contracts SV_EDIT – FAQ 
These functions are designed for users who prefer not to use our built-in crypto or

The expiry setting defines how long the heist contract is valid before it expires, measured in minutes.

2.4.6 How do I set the time before the heist starts?
The timeToStart setting defines the time, in minutes, before the heist contract officially begins after it is accepted.

2.4.7 How do I set the minimum number of players required for the heist?
The minMembers setting specifies the minimum number of players required to start the heist contract.

2.4.8 How do I set the maximum number of players for the heist?

The dispatch settings allow you to enable or disable dispatch messages for the heist contract. You can set the code, title, and message for the dispatch notification.

2.4.15 How can I use black money as a reward in heists?
Check section 1.2.6 for the answer. For heist contracts, black money can be used as a reward.

2.4.16 Do I have to use the NoPixel and Gabz maps for heists?
No, it is not required to use these maps for heist contracts. However, the script is preconfigured for these maps, meaning if you want to use other maps, you will need to manually adjust the locations in each heist contract file.

This issue is caused by changes to the gold trolley variables. You should revert the variables back due to an animation issue in the heist contract.

2.4.20 I see 'ITEM not found' in the black market, what should I do?
This issue occurs when the items are not properly added to the inventory or when the inventory is started after the heist contract script.

2.4.21 I get an 'UNKNOWN' error when purchasing from the black market, what should I do?
This issue happens when the crypto value is set to 0 in the black market. The crypto/gcoin value must be at least 1 for purchases to work in heist contracts.

2.4.22 My server crashes due to a loop in the console, how do I fix it?
To resolve this, go to lunar_heistcontracts\config\contracts\cargo.lua, find itemCount (which is set to 3 by default), change it to 2, and restart the server.

2.4.23 I’m not receiving dispatch notifications for heists, what should I do?
First, check if your dispatch script is supported. If it isn’t, add it to the bridge. If it is supported, ask the customer which heist contract they are testing. It’s common for the boosting contracts "d" and "c" to be tested, but these have hasTracker = false by default, which results in no dispatch notification being sent. Make sure that hasTracker = true is enabled.

22 
3.1 Lunar Jobscreator  Config.lua - FAQ 
3.1.1 How do I open the Jobscreator?
After a successful installation, you should be able to open the Jobscreator by using the /jobscreator command.

3.1.2 /jobscreator command doesn’t exist, what should I do?
If the /jobscreator command doesn’t exist, it is possible that the file has become corrupted. If the customer is using FileZilla, advise them to upload the script using a program like WinSCP, then try again.

3.1.3 I’m typing /jobscreator, but nothing happens or I get a permission error, what should I do?
This happens if you haven’t added add_ace group.admin jobscreator_admin allow to the server.cfg. Make sure this line is included to grant the necessary permissions for Jobscreator.

3.1.4 How do I translate the Jobscreator?
To translate the Jobscreator, you need to create a language file (e.g., en.json) in two locations:

lunar_jobscreator\locales

lunar_jobscreator\web\dist\locales

3.1.5 Can I add multiple account types, such as society or black_money?
Yes, if these account types are registered in your framework, you can add them to Config.accounts. By default, only money and bank are available in the Jobscreator configuration.

3.1.6 Can I use an actions menu for all interactions?
Yes, go to the config.lua file and look for Config.actionsMenu. By default, it is set to true. If you want to disable it, set it to false.

3.1.7 Can I use a radial menu for all interactions?
Yes, go to the config.lua file and look for Config.radialMenu. By default, it is set to false. If you want to enable the radial menu, set it to true.

3.1.8 Can I disable target interactions?
Yes, go to the config.lua file and look for Config.disableTargetInteractions. Set it to true to disable interactions through your target resource in the Jobscreator.

3.1.9 I didn’t receive any SQL files, what should I do?
This is normal. The SQL files for Jobscreator are automatically created and set up when you start the script for the first time.

3.1.10 I get a "Refreshjobs" error and my jobs aren’t saving, what should I do?
This issue occurs due to an outdated ESX version, as it lacks the Refreshjobs function. Update to a more recent version of ESX to resolve the issue and ensure jobs are properly saved in Jobscreator.

3.1.11 I get the esx_society warning "attempted to open menu" (usually with a long ID in the name), what should I do?
To resolve this, the customer must add esx_society as a dependency on line 15 of the fxmanifest.lua for the Jobscreator. Additionally, the job must be recreated entirely; duplicates will not work in this case.

3.1.12 /convertjobs isn’t working, how do I convert my existing jobs to the Jobscreator?
The /convertjobs command is designed to convert jobs from the Lunar Unijob (v1) or Jobscreator's previous version to the current one. Unfortunately, you cannot convert your existing jobs directly to the Jobscreator. You will need to recreate the jobs manually in the new format.
24 
3.2 Lunar JobsCreator CL_EDIT  – FAQ 
3.2.1 I get the warning 'No script for clothing found! Supported: fivem appearance/illenium-appearance/qb-clothing.' What should I do?
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the function Editable.openCloakroom. Add your clothing resource here so the cloakroom will function properly.

3.2.2 I don’t receive keys when taking a vehicle from the garage. What should I do?
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the functions Editable.onVehicleSpawned and Editable.onVehicleSaved. Configure these functions to give a key when a vehicle is spawned and remove it when stored.

3.2.3 My stash doesn’t work, or I get the error 'Your inventory script doesn’t support stashes.' What should I do?
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the function Editable.openStash. Add the correct exports for your inventory system—missing exports are likely causing the issue. If you are using QB Inventory, contact Sam for assistance.

3.2.4 My shop doesn’t work, or I get the error 'Configure cl_edit.lua shops for your inventory.' What should I do?
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the function Editable.openShop. Add the correct shop exports from your inventory script to the Jobscreator.

3.2.5 I want to set specific conditions for interactions, such as preventing handcuffing when a player is dead. How do I do this?
Go to Editable.canInteractFilter in lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and add the required conditions. You can configure different interaction restrictions based on various factors.

3.2.6 I try to search a player, but nothing happens. What should I do?
Check the function Editable.searchPlayer in lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and ensure the exports match your inventory script.
   
 
  26 
 
3.2.7 I try to open the boss menu in JobsCreator, but nothing happens. What should I do?
The JobsCreator itself does not include a boss menu but instead triggers an external boss menu script. Go to Editable.openBossMenu and ensure your boss menu script is installed and correctly configured. If you use a custom boss menu, add it to the function Editable.openBossMenu.

3.2.8 I get an error when trying to open the boss menu in JobsCreator, but I use QBX Management. What should I do?
Remove the following code from the function Editable.openBossMenu:
elseif isStarted('esx_society') then
Framework.object.UI.Menu.CloseAll()
TriggerEvent('esx_society:openBossMenu', job.name,
function(data, menu)
if menu then
menu.close()
end
end, {
wash = job.canWash,
grades = false,
salary = false
})
Restart the server, and it should now work.

3.2.9 I get the warning: 'Inventory images path not set in cl_edit.lua for JobsCreator!' What should I do?
Check Editable.getInventoryIcon in lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and ensure your inventory script is listed. If not, add the correct path to your inventory images for JobsCreator.

3.2.10 How do I change the keybind for tackling or the interaction menu in JobsCreator?
Go to Binds.interact & Binds.actionsMenu in lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit. Here, you can modify the keybind settings for JobsCreator.
 
 
 
3.3 Lunar Jobscreator SV_EDIT – FAQ 
3.3.1 How can I add my own banking/society system to the JobsCreator?
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\sv_edit and locate the functions:
• Editable.getSocietyMoney
• Editable.addSocietyMoney
Modify these functions to integrate your custom banking or society system into JobsCreator.

3.3.2 I use QBox and Renewed Banking, but I get a sv_edit warning that my banking script cannot be fetched in JobsCreator.
This is expected because the exports do not work for QBox. You may need to manually integrate QBox banking functions into the JobsCreator script.

3.3.3 I want to integrate my own garage script into JobsCreator. Where can I do this?
Technically, you can modify the functions:
• Editable.getVehicles
• Editable.saveVehicle
However, it is not recommended to change these functions because the included garage system works differently. The built-in garage is specifically for work vehicles. In most cases, it’s easier to manually add a garage entry to your existing garage system instead of modifying these functions within JobsCreator.

3.3.4 I can't park my personal vehicle in the garage in JobsCreator. Why not?
This is expected behavior. The JobsCreator garage only supports vehicles purchased in the jobs vehicle shop. It is not meant for personal vehicles.

3.3.5 My webhooks are not saving in JobsCreator. What should I do?
Go to sv_edit.lua and search for the database creation query related to webhooks. Replace the existing create table statement with the following SQL snippet:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lunar_jobscreator_webhooks (
name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
url varchar(1000) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (name)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;
Restart your server, and the webhooks should now save correctly in JobsCreator.

3.3.6 I use Lunar JobsCreator and Lunar Multijob, but money paid into the cash register doesn’t go to the correct society in JobsCreator.
Replace the entire addSocietyMoney function in sv_edit.lua with the following snippet:
---@param society string
---@param amount integer
function Editable.addSocietyMoney(society, amount)
exports['lunar_multijob']:addAccountBalance(society, amount)
end
This ensures that payments go to the correct society account when using Lunar Multijob with JobsCreator.
