1. Lunar_bridge 
1.1 What is Lunar Bridge? 
Lunar Bridge is a script that manages shared configurations for all paid Lunar Scripts 
products. It allows administrators to configure settings such as framework integration, 
notifications, text UI, and dispatch once, and these settings are automatically applied 
across all Lunar Scripts products. This ensures consistent and efficient configuration 
across all scripts. 
1.2 Lunar Bridge - FAQ 
1.2.1 Can I integrate my own dispatch system, and if so, where? 
Yes, you can integrate a new dispatch script in 
lunar_bridge\dispatch\server.lua. Don't forget to select the correct dispatch 
system in config\config.lua. 
1.2.2 Where can I find the framework folders? 
All framework-related resources within Lunar Scripts can be found in 
lunar_bridge\framework\. You can choose between qb or esx. 
1.2.3 How can I add more jobs that receive dispatch notifications? 
Navigate to lunar_bridge\config\config.lua and locate the Config.Dispatch 
function. Here, you can configure the jobs that should receive dispatch notifications. 
1.2.4 How can I make changes to the Lunar 3D prompt? 
Go to lunar_bridge\config\config.lua and look for Config.Prompts. You can 
modify the prompt configuration here. 
1.2.5 I want to use a target resource instead of the Lunar 3D prompt. How can I do 
this? 
In lunar_bridge\config\config.lua, find Config.Target. By default, this is set to 
false. Change it to true to enable the use of a target resource. 
11 
1.2.6 How can I use black money as a reward in heists? 
First, navigate to lunar_bridge\config\config.lua and find Config.BlackMoney. 
Configure your black money item and choose whether it uses metadata. 
Next, you need to modify the account type for each contract. Locate the respective 
contract file in lunar_heistcontracts\contracts\ and change account = money 
to the black money item you configured earlier. Below are specific lines to edit for each 
heist: 
• Art Asylum: Line 367 and 597 - Change money to black_money 
• Bobcat: Line 102 - Change money to black_money 
• Cash Exchange: Line 85 and 136 - Change money to black_money 
• Fleeca: Line 62 and 98 - Change money to black_money 
• Laundromat: Line 94 - Change money to black_money 
• Maze Bank: Line 43 and 381 - Change money to black_money 
• Pacific: Line 177 and 284 - Change money to black_money 
• Paleto: Line 173, 196, and 240 - Change money to black_money 
By following these steps, you can successfully configure black money rewards in 
heists.

2. Lunar Heistcontracts 
General Information about Heist Contracts 
To successfully start Heist Contracts in the correct order, ensure the following 
dependencies are loaded in this sequence: 
1. ox_lib 
2. Framework 
3. oxmysql 
4. lunar_bridge 
5. lunar_heistcontracts 
6. lunar_minigames (This should be started after heistcontracts) 
7. Other dependencies 
The Heist Contracts script is highly detailed, so I’ve broken the FAQ into multiple 
sections to make it easier to understand. The structure is as follows: 
• First, we’ll cover the config.lua. 
• Then, the client-side (cl_edit) and server-side (sv_edit) configurations. 
• Lastly, we’ll look at general contract settings and common questions. This 
section does not go into specifics about individual contracts but instead covers 
the general settings and frequently asked questions. 
2.1 Lunar Heist Contracts Config.lua - FAQ 
2.1.1 How often are new contracts generated? 
Contracts are generated every Config.generator.minutesBetweenGeneration 
minutes. By default, this is set to 2 minutes (recommend not to change due 
performance). 
2.1.2 What is the maximum number of contracts that can be generated? 
The system stops generating new contracts once it reaches Config.generator.max. 
The default maximum is 16(recommend not to set this higher than 32). 
2.1.3 How many contracts can a player own at once? 
A player can hold up to Config.generator.playerLimit contracts. By default, this is 
set to 2. 
13 
2.1.4 How frequently are expired contracts removed? 
Expired contracts are automatically cleared every 10 minutes, based on 
Config.generator.clearCron. 
2.1.5 Can multiple heists run at the same time? 
Certain heists cannot be started simultaneously. You can define these in 
Config.limitedHeists. 
2.1.6 Can I override how cryptocurrency or experience is calculated? 
Yes, set Config.overrideCrypto or Config.overrideExperience to true and 
implement custom logic in sv_edit.lua. 
2.1.7 How can I give admin access to the heist contract system? 
For ESX, assign admin groups in Config.adminGroups. 
For QBCore, you need to add the following line to your server.cfg: 
add_ace group.admin contracts_admin allow   
2.1.8 Where can players buy heist-related items? 
Players can purchase items from an NPC defined in Config.ped. Items include 
hacking tools, explosives, and drills. 
2.1.9 What currency is used to buy items? 
The Config.ped.buyAccount setting determines this, defaulting to in-game money. 
2.1.10 Can players sell items for money or crypto? 
Yes, items can be sold for cash or cryptocurrency as specified in 
Config.ped.sellItems. 
2.1.11 How many players are displayed on the leaderboard? 
The leaderboard displays the top Config.leaderboard.limit players. The default is 
10. 
14 
2.1.12 How can I translate the script? 
To translate the script, create a new JSON file in the lunar_heistcontracts\locales\ 
directory (use the language abbreviation as the filename, e.g., en.json for English). 
Then, add your translations within that file. 
2.1.13 I didn’t receive any SQL files, what should I do? 
This is normal. The SQL files are automatically created and set up when you start the 
script for the first time 
15 
2.2 Lunar Heist Contracts CL_EDIT  – FAQ 
2.2.1 How can I adjust the minigames, such as time and quantity? 
You can modify the minigames in the lunar_heistcontracts\config\cl_edit file. 
Look for Editable.minigames where you can change settings like time and quantity 
for each contract and minigame. 
2.2.2 Can I use other minigames? 
Yes, you can. In the Editable.minigames section, you can modify the export and 
associated code to use a different minigame of your choice. 
2.2.3 Can I use minigames from lunar_minigames in other scripts? 
Yes, it is possible. You can use the exports from cl_edit Editable.minigames and 
apply them in other scripts. 
2.2.4 I’m not getting vehicle keys during a heist. 
Ensure that your vehiclekey script is integrated into the cl_edit functions 
Editable.addKeys and Editable.removeKeys. 
2.2.5 My item icons are not loading. 
Check the cl_edit function Editable.setInventoryBusy and make sure the path 
to the images is correct. This issue typically occurs with inventories that are not 
supported; if that’s the case, it would have been mentioned. 
16 
2.3 Lunar Heist Contracts SV_EDIT – FAQ 
These functions are designed for users who prefer not to use our built-in crypto or 
experience systems but want to implement their own custom methods. You can add 
your own exports to the provided functions to manage crypto and experience according 
to your needs. 
2.3.1 How can I get a player's crypto balance? 
Use the function Editable.getPlayerCrypto(identifier) to retrieve the player's crypto 
balance. This function requires Config.overrideCrypto to be true and is meant for users 
who wish to manage their own crypto system. Add your custom export to implement 
your own crypto management. 
2.3.2 How can I add crypto to a player? 
Use the function Editable.addPlayerCrypto(identifier, amount) to add crypto. This 
function requires Config.overrideCrypto to be true and is meant for users who wish to 
manage their own crypto system.

Use the function Editable.getPlayerExperience(identifier) to retrieve the player's 
experience points. This function is intended for users who want to use their own custom 
experience system instead of the default one. 
2.3.5 How can I add experience points to a player? 
Use the function Editable.addPlayerExperience(identifier, amount) to add experience 
points. This function will work only if Config.overrideExperience is true and is for those 
implementing their own experience system. 
2.3.6 How can I remove experience points from a player? 
Use the function Editable.removePlayerExperience(identifier, amount) to 
remove experience points. This requires Config.overrideExperience to be true 
and allows you to implement your own experience management system. 
17 
2.4 Lunar Heist Contracts General Contract – FAQ 
2.4.1 How can I disable a heist contract? 
You can disable a contract by setting the disabled setting to true within the contract 
configuration. By default, it is set to false. If you set it to true, the contract will be 
disabled. 
2.4.2 How do I set the chance of a heist happening? 
The chance setting determines the likelihood of the heist occurring. It is represented as 
a percentage, where the value is between 0 and 100. 
2.4.3 How do I set the price in GCoin for the heist contract? 
The price setting defines the cost of the heist contract. This is the amount that players 
need to pay to initiate the contract. 
2.4.4 How can I require a specific amount of experience to access the heist? 
The requiredExperience setting specifies the amount of experience a player must 
have to be eligible for the heist contract. If the player doesn't meet this requirement, 
they will not be able to participate. 
2.4.5 How do I set the expiration time for a heist contract? 
The expiry setting defines how long the heist contract is valid before it expires, 
measured in minutes. 
2.4.6 How do I set the time before the heist starts?

after it is accepted. 
2.4.7 How do I set the minimum number of players required for the heist? 
The minMembers setting specifies the minimum number of players required to start the 
heist. 
2.4.8 How do I set the maximum number of players for the heist? 
The maxMembers setting defines the maximum number of players allowed to participate 
in the heist. This is optional and can be left out if not needed. 
2.4.9 Can I add other types of rewards to the heist contract? 
Yes, you can add various types of rewards in the rewards setting, such as crypto, 
experience, or other items. 
18 
2.4.10 How do I set the minimum number of police officers required for the heist?

2.4.13 How do I configure the blip on the map for the heist? 
You can customize the blip that shows up on the map by configuring the blip settings, 
including the name, sprite, size, and color. 
2.4.14 How do I enable the dispatch for the heist? 
The dispatch settings allow you to enable or disable dispatch messages for the heist. 
You can set the code, title, and message for the dispatch notification. 
2.4.15 How can I use black money as a reward in heists? 
Check section 1.2.6 for the answer. 
Here’s the additional FAQ with the new questions and answers: 
2.4.16 Do I have to use the NoPixel and Gabz maps? 
No, it is not required to use these maps. However, the script is preconfigured for these 
maps, meaning if you want to use other maps, you will need to manually adjust the 
locations in each contract file. 
19 
2.4.17 Which maps are preconfigured? 
• Gabz:  
o Fleeca Bank 
o Pacific Bank 
o Bobcat 
o Paleto Bank 
• NoPixel: 
o Maze Bank 
o Art Asylum 
o Cash Exchange 
o Laundromat 
For more details, visit: 
• Gabz: https://fivem.gabzv.com/ 
• NoPixel: https://store.nopixel.net/category/assets 
2.4.18 Can I add my own custom contracts? 
No, custom contracts or existing robberies cannot be added to the script/tablet. 
2.4.19 My gold bars are added and removed from my inventory, what should I do? 
This issue is caused by changes to the gold trolley variables. You should revert the 
variables back due to an animation issue. 
2.4.20 I see 'ITEM not found' in the black market, what should I do? 
This issue occurs when the items are not properly added to the inventory or when the 
inventory is started after the heist contract script. 
2.4.21 I get an 'UNKNOWN' error when purchasing from the black market, what should I 
do? 
This issue happens when the crypto value is set to 0 in the black market. The 
crypto/gcoin value must be at least 1 for purchases to work. 
2.4.22 My server crashes due to a loop in the console, how do I fix it? 
To resolve this, go to lunar_heistcontracts\config\contracts\cargo.lua, find 
itemCount (which is set to 3 by default), change it to 2, and restart the server. 
20 
2.4.23 I’m not receiving dispatch notifications, what should I do? 
First, check if your dispatch script is supported. If it isn’t, add it to the bridge. If it is 
supported, ask the customer which contract they are testing. It’s common for the 
boosting contracts "d" and "c" to be tested, but these have hasTracker = false by 
default, which results in no dispatch notification being sent. Make sure that 
hasTracker = true is enabled.

3. Lunar_jobscreator  
General Information about Jobscreator 
To successfully start Jobscreator in the correct order, ensure the following 
dependencies are loaded in this sequence: 
1. ox_lib 
2. Framework 
3. oxmysql 
4. lunar_bridge 
5. lunar_jobscreator 
6. Other dependencies may be required depending on your setup. 
The Jobscreator script is highly detailed, so I’ve broken the FAQ into multiple sections 
to make it easier to understand. The structure is as follows: 
• First, we’ll cover the config.lua. 
• Then, we will explore the client-side (cl_edit) and server-side (sv_edit) 
configurations. 
• Lastly, we’ll look at general job settings and common questions. This section 
will not go into specifics about individual jobs but will instead cover the general 
settings and frequently asked questions. 
22 
3.1 Lunar Jobscreator  Config.lua - FAQ 
3.1.1 How do I open the Jobscreator? 
After a successful installation, you should be able to open it by using the /jobscreator 
command. 
3.1.2 /jobscreator command doesn’t exist, what should I do? 
If the /jobscreator command doesn’t exist, it is possible that the file has become 
corrupted. If the customer is using FileZilla, advise them to upload the script using a 
program like WinSCP, then try again. 
3.1.3 I’m typing /jobscreator, but nothing happens or I get a permission error, what 
should I do? 
This happens if you haven’t added add_ace group.admin jobscreator_admin 
allow to the server.cfg. Make sure this line is included to grant the necessary 
permissions. 
3.1.4 How do I translate the Jobscreator? 
To translate the Jobscreator, you need to create a language file (e.g., en.json) in two 
locations: 
1. lunar_jobscreator\locales 
2. lunar_jobscreator\web\dist\locales 
3.1.5 Can I add multiple account types, such as society or black_money? 
Yes, if these account types are registered in your framework, you can add them to 
Config.accounts. By default, only money and bank are available. 
3.1.6 Can I use an actions menu for all interactions? 
Yes, go to the config.lua file and look for Config.actionsMenu. By default, it is set 
to true. If you want to disable it, set it to false. 
3.1.7 Can I use a radial menu for all interactions? 
Yes, go to the config.lua file and look for Config.radialMenu. By default, it is set to 
false. If you want to enable the radial menu, set it to true. 
3.1.8 Can I disable target interactions? 
Yes, go to the config.lua file and look for Config.disableTargetInteractions. 
Set it to true to disable interactions through your target resource. 
23 
3.1.9 I didn’t receive any SQL files, what should I do? 
This is normal. The SQL files are automatically created and set up when you start the 
script for the first time. 
3.1.10 I get a "Refreshjobs" error and my jobs aren’t saving, what should I do? 
This issue occurs due to an outdated ESX version, as it lacks the Refreshjobs 
function. Update to a more recent version of ESX to resolve the issue. 
3.1.11 I get the esx_society warning "attempted to open menu" (usually with a long ID in 
the name), what should I do? 
To resolve this, the customer must add esx_society as a dependency on line 15 of the 
fxmanifest.lua for the Jobscreator. Additionally, the job must be recreated entirely; 
duplicates will not work in this case. 
3.1.12 /convertjobs isn’t working, how do I convert my existing jobs to the Jobscreator? 
The /convertjobs command is designed to convert jobs from the Lunar Unijob (v1) or 
Jobscreator's previous version to the current one. Unfortunately, you cannot convert 
your existing jobs directly to the Jobscreator. You will need to recreate the jobs 
manually in the new format. 
24 
3.2 Lunar JobsCreator CL_EDIT  – FAQ 
3.2.1 I get the warning 'No script for clothing found! Supported: fivem
appearance/illenium-appearance/qb-clothing.' What should I do? 
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the function 
Editable.openCloakroom. Add your clothing resource here so the cloakroom will 
function properly. 
3.2.2 I don’t receive keys when taking a vehicle from the garage. What should I do? 
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the functions 
Editable.onVehicleSpawned and Editable.onVehicleSaved. Configure these 
functions to give a key when a vehicle is spawned and remove it when stored. 
3.2.3 My stash doesn’t work, or I get the error 'Your inventory script doesn’t support 
stashes.' What should I do? 
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the function 
Editable.openStash. Add the correct exports for your inventory system—missing 
exports are likely causing the issue. If you are using QB Inventory, contact Sam for 
assistance. 
3.2.4 My shop doesn’t work, or I get the error 'Configure cl_edit.lua shops for your 
inventory.' What should I do? 
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the function 
Editable.openShop. Add the correct shop exports from your inventory script to the 
Jobscreator. 
3.2.5 I want to set specific conditions for interactions, such as preventing handcuffing 
when a player is dead. How do I do this? 
Go to Editable.canInteractFilter in lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and 
add the required conditions. You can configure different interaction restrictions based 
on various factors. 
3.2.6 I try to search a player, but nothing happens. What should I do? 
Check the function Editable.searchPlayer in 
lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and ensure the exports match your inventory 
script. 
25 
   
 
  26 
 
3.2.7 I try to open the boss menu, but nothing happens. What should I do? 
The Jobscreator itself does not include a boss menu but instead triggers an external 
boss menu script. Go to Editable.openBossMenu and ensure your boss menu script 
is installed and correctly configured. If you use a custom boss menu, add it to the 
function Editable.openBossMenu. 
3.2.8 I get an error when trying to open the boss menu, but I use QBX Management. What 
should I do? 
Remove the following code from the function Editable.openBossMenu: 
elseif isStarted('esx_society') then 
    Framework.object.UI.Menu.CloseAll() 
    TriggerEvent('esx_society:openBossMenu', job.name, 
function(data, menu) 
        if menu then 
            menu.close() 
        end 
    end, { 
        wash = job.canWash, 
        grades = false, 
        salary = false 
    }) 
  
Restart the server, and it should now work. 
3.2.9 I get the warning: 'Inventory images path not set in cl_edit.lua!' What should I do? 
Check Editable.getInventoryIcon in lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and 
ensure your inventory script is listed. If not, add the correct path to your inventory 
images. 
3.2.10 How do I change the keybind for tackling or the interaction menu? 
Go to Binds.interact & Binds.actionsMenu in 
lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit. Here, you can modify the keybind settings. 
 
 
 
3.3 Lunar Jobscreator SV_EDIT – FAQ 
3.3.1 How can I add my own banking/society system to the Jobscreator? 
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\sv_edit and locate the functions: 
• Editable.getSocietyMoney 
• Editable.addSocietyMoney 
Modify these functions to integrate your custom banking or society system. 
3.3.2 I use QBox and Renewed Banking, but I get a sv_edit warning that my banking script 
cannot be fetched. 
This is expected because the exports do not work for QBox. You may need to manually 
integrate QBox banking functions into the script. 
3.3.3 I want to integrate my own garage script. Where can I do this? 
Technically, you can modify the functions: 
• Editable.getVehicles 
• Editable.saveVehicle 
However, it is not recommended to change these functions because the included 
garage system works differently. The built-in garage is specifically for work vehicles. In 
most cases, it’s easier to manually add a garage entry to your existing garage system 
instead of modifying these functions. 
3.3.4 I can't park my personal vehicle in the garage. Why not? 
This is expected behavior. The Jobscreator garage only supports vehicles purchased in 
the jobs vehicle shop. It is not meant for personal vehicles. 
27 
3.3.5 My webhooks are not saving. What should I do? 
Go to sv_edit.lua and search for the database creation query related to webhooks. 
Replace the existing create table statement with the following SQL snippet: 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lunar_jobscreator_webhooks ( 
name varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
url varchar(1000) NOT NULL, 
PRIMARY KEY (name) 
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci; 
Restart your server, and the webhooks should now save correctly. 
3.3.6 I use Lunar Jobscreator and Lunar Multijob, but money paid into the cash register 
doesn’t go to the correct society. 
Replace the entire addSocietyMoney function in sv_edit.lua with the following 
snippet: ---@param society string ---@param amount integer 
function Editable.addSocietyMoney(society, amount) 
exports['lunar_multijob']:addAccountBalance(society, amount) 
end 
This ensures that payments go to the correct society account when using Lunar 
Multijob.

The Jobscreator itself does not include a boss menu, but it triggers an external boss 
menu script. Go to Editable.openBossMenu and ensure your boss menu script is 
installed and correctly configured. If you are using a custom boss menu, add it to the 
Editable.openBossMenu function. 
3.4.6.1 Cloakroom 
3.4.6.1.1 I get the warning 'No script for clothing found! Supported: fivem
appearance/illenium-appearance/qb-clothing.' What should I do? 
Go to lunar_jobscreator\config\cl_edit and locate the function 
Editable.openCloakroom. Add your clothing resource here so the cloakroom will 
function properly.
